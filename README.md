## üß† Project Overview

Sleep efficiency is a vital indicator of sleep quality and overall health. This project utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms to forecast sleep efficiency using behavioral and lifestyle-related data. It aims to assist individuals and healthcare professionals in identifying patterns that influence sleep and promote better sleep hygiene.
